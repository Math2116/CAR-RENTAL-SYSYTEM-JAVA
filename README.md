This is a simple console-based Car Rental System built in Java.
It allows users to:

View the list of available cars

Rent a car

Return a rented car

Each car has a model name, rental price per day, and rental status.
The system updates the availability of cars dynamically when rented or returned.

This project demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts like:

Classes and Objects (Car class)

Encapsulation (car details and rental state)

ArrayList for managing multiple cars

Loops and Conditionals for program control

Use case:
Perfect for beginners to understand how OOP can be applied to real-world scenarios like managing car rental
